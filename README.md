### Hi there üëã

I ‚ù§Ô∏è building tools that help the ML/AI engineer be more productive.


- üí¨ Ask me about LLMs, (prob) generative models, SciML, Gaussian Processes, FMUs, and more.
- üì´ How to reach me: [Email](mailto:sharanyalburgi@gmail.com) | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sharanry/) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sharanry)


I am tinkering with:
- Mechanistic Interpretability
- Structured Generation
- Foundational Scientific Models

I have previously worked on 
- [Turing.jl](https://github.com/TuringLang/Turing.jl) - A Julia based probabilistic programming language.
- [Gaussian Processes](https://githhttps://github.com/JuliaGaussianProcesses) - A Gaussian Processes ecosytem in Julia.
- [PyMC](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc) - A Python based probabilistic programming language with a TensorFlow backend.

I ‚ù§Ô∏è working with:
- Languages: [Julia](https://julialang.org/), [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B)
- DL: [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/)
- LLMs: 
  - Outputs: [guidance](https://github.com/guidance-ai/guidance), [Outlines](https://outlines-dev.github.io/outlines/)
  - Inputs: [DSPy](https://dspy-docs.vercel.app/)
- ProbML: [AbstractGPs.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGaussianProcesses/AbstractGPs.jl), [Turing.jl](https://github.com/TuringLang/Turing.jl)
- SciML: [OrdinaryDiffEq.jl](https://github.com/SciML/OrdinaryDiffEq.jl)
- Web: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
